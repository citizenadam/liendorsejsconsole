This can be run from the console by pushing (usuall) F12 in the browser and selecting the console.

Update 9/30/24:  This stopped working a couple of weeks after using it, kind of flattering that linkedin changed things up just for this script.  I've updated it using Claude since I don't know much about anti automation coding.  It works again.

Usage


1. Go to the persons linked in skills page you want to endorse:
     https://www.linkedin.com/in/<USERNAME)/details/skills/
2. In Chrome/Firefox press F12 to bring up the dev tools, click on console.
3. Paste this js code into the Blinking cursor area of the console and press enter. There is a 2 second delay between endorsements.
4. If you want you can remove the delay but you might get blocked by linked in.
